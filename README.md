# Analysis of Global Disease Outbreaks 

In this project, I will be analyzing various reported cases of diseases such as HIV/AIDS, and Malaria in the top 3 third world countries. The main focus will be Afghanistan, Angola, and Bangladesh as the points of interest, and using 1st World Countries as a reference point. For my analysis, I will be using Canada and the United States as my reference points. The Dataset used for this analysis was obtained through Kaggle, additional information was retrieved from the World Health Organization. 

Process Breakdown: 

## Step 1: Exploring the Dataset obtained 
- In this step, I reviewed the dataset and removed/transformed any null values/columns.

## Step 2: Peformed EDA 
- Further clean, transform/renaming columns do my analysis. Create visualizations to put into a dashboard.

## Step 3: Visualization Dashboards
- Created and put together visualizations that show the trend of reported cases of Malaria and HIV/AIDS over the span of 30 years, and forecasting(estimating) the reported cases in the next 4 years (2028).

## Main Goal 
Within this project, I try to answer the question of which Countries are more susceptible to a future outbreak by analyzing the cases reported overtime, and the trend present within the graphs I have created. Based on the World Health Organization, Malaria is a disease that is spread through a parasite (mosquitoes) and is a preventable and curable disease. On the other hand, HIV/AIDS does not have a cure, and is a disease that is spread through bodily fluids (saliva, blood, semen, etc.).
